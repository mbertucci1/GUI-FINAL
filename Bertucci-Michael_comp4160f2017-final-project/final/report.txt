  Final Project


The project was to develop a personal page to display a gallery of photos/images 
(this is the professor's project idea). I based my approach on the criteria in the 
assignment description. I tried to find libraries that would help with some of the
more complicated features, like a a list that can be reorganized by dragging and 
dropping (I used Muuri), a way to upload images to a server via file dialog and
dragging/dropping (I used DropzoneJS), and a way to perform image processing
(I found CamanJS after failed attemps with other libraries like Jimp and fabricjs).

I did not copy any code wholesale from another source.

Parts of the code that were modified from elsewhere:

1. Code for constructing the Muuri object (the drag-n-drop grid) was 
   modified from their demo at https://haltu.github.io/muuri/

2. The sorting algorithm used for restoring the saved order or the grid
   items upon page load was modified from georg's answer on
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13304543/javascript-sort-array-based-on-another-array

3. The html template and basic structure of the function to create and control the 
   image editing dialog were modified from the tutorial at
   https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-canvas-image-editor-with-canvas--net-18143

   NOTE!
   I could not get the actual image editing to work. I tried several different
   libraries and each attempt yielded errors that I was unable to resolve. 
   
   I finally stumbled upon CamanJS which I was able to make use of for some of 
   the operations, like brightness and cropping, but by that point I didn't have time
   to build all the controls for the user to change those values, so I hardcoded 
   some values just to demonstrate the functionality.
